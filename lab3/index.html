	<h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
	<p>I think the idea of this lab is to push us further develop our file structure and personal homepage.</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>During this process, I met some problems about font, style and html rules. But the biggest one I met is network issue. It
	is really tough for me to conneting canvas and github page. So I alwasy take a lot of time to figure it out or just wait.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>I successfully made the file structure but I failed to make the internet good :(</p>
